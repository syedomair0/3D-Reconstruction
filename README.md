# 3D-Reconstruction

Some things that I learned in my senior year in High School semester about different techniques and methods in Computer Vision

## Goal
- To learn as much as possible about computer vision and specifically dense 3-D reconstructions from videos.  

## What did I learn ??
- Libraries   
  - OpenCV
  - scikit-learn 
  - numpy
- Image and video manipulations
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_FAST_and_rotated_BRIEF](Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF(ORB) feature detector)
- Corner detection 
- Image Segmentation 
- basics of augmented reality
